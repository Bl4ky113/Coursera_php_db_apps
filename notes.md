# OOP in PHP

This course promises to go on full speed and more. Let's see if he can make up to his words.

Looks like this modules will be the general OOP talk.
Php uses the same arrow operator to access attributes and methods like C uses them to access values on structs.
Also, when defining methods, we can access the reference of the class or object by using "$this".

We can define static attributes by using "const" before defining a normal variable inside the class.
Also, in order to access these static items, we have to use this operator "::".

There's nice stuff like the life cycle, that uses some special methods just like python. Some of theese are:
- \_\_construct: The init and constructor of the obj, nothing fancy
- \_\_destruct: The destoy of the obj, something new and nice

Awww man, they only explained those two, but skipped the others shown.

Inheritance can be done by this syntax:

class foo extends bar {
    ...
}
